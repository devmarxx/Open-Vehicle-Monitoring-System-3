## Welcome to my OVMS clone

I started this project 2020 to develop the OVMS modul for the

### VW e-Up

The intial goal was to replace the VW TCU with OVMS and implement as much of the original VW "remote" features of the car as possible.

For me the main focus was on implementing the remote climate control. Therefor I had to go an unusual way by accessing the CAN bus of the car directly.

I managed that via the original T26A plug of the OCU.

Later in the project other devs started working on direct OBD access to get more valuable data from the car, so with that team we managed to build a serious, fully working OVMS modul for the e-Up and its siblings.

I surely learned a lot about the CAN bus and car connectivity.

I hope the code is usefull for future projects.

Enjoy :-)
